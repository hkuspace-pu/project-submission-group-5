# Natural Science Survey System
Natural science projects often involve developing a comprehensive and consistent method of
survey for the recording of species (e.g., birds, trees, butterflies). Survey information such as
location, date, time, name of surveyor are gathered through the use of a survey form. Observation
notes such as behaviour (e.g., resting, foraging), measurements (e.g., an adult bird; a chrysalis
butterfly; a 2m tall tree), or conditions (e.g., an injured bird, a butterfly with a broken wing, a tree
with root damage). The records should subsequently enable researchers to trace individual
species and assess changes associated with particular specimens.
Paper cards or forms are traditionally used for recording. Though time-honoured and reliable,
information such as the exact time and location of the records cannot easily recorded. Data
retrieval and archival can be inefficient. There is also no efficient and effective way to record the
related multimedia information (e.g., photos, videos, audio recordings).
This project is about developing a cross-platform system to:
* help surveyors keep records in a convenient and reliable way; and
* inspire a love to nature to the general public.
