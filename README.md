# Natural Science Survey System
## Project Vision
The Natural Science Survey System is a comprehensive and consistent approach to surveying species records. It aims to provide a reliable and easy way for surveyors to document and share their measurements, helping researchers track individual species and assess changes associated with specific specimens.

# Deployment
The backend server was not running properly during presentation. We have migrated our backend server to AWS which will provide us with greater reliability and scalability. The AWS server will be operational non-stop from June 1st, 2023 to October 31st, 2023. Please note that the QR code / URL link to the prototype is still functional and can be accessed at any time without any issues.
